I specialize in designing and deploying scalable, user-friendly applications with a focus on clean code and performance optimization. My experience spans both frontend and backend development, as well as server management and deployment automation using CI/CD pipelines and PM2. I am particularly interested in integrating AI and small language models into web applications to deliver smarter solutions. I have worked on projects involving satellite data analysis for agricultural monitoring and irrigation systems, combining innovation with real-world problem-solving. Currently, I am building my portfolio and preparing to launch a YouTube channel on data structures and algorithms to share knowledge with the developer community."

During my academic journey, I developed a strong foundation in molecular biology, plant breeding, and bioinformatics, which gave me valuable experience in scientific research and data analysis. For my Master’s thesis, I focused on identifying microRNAs in Mentha longifolia (wild mint) using BLASTN and Enfold software. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in working with biological data, computational tools, and problem-solving in a research-driven environment. Although my career path later shifted toward software development, my academic background continues to shape my analytical thinking and systematic approach to solving complex problems. The combination of scientific training and programming skills enables me to connect theory with application, which I now apply in creating innovative, data-driven software solutions."
